# AudiobookHelperForSpotify

A helper app using Spotify's Android Remote SDK for pausing and resuming audiobooks as Spotify treats them as normal tracks and doesn't care about where one left.
Due to limitations of the SDK this project has some limitations and I am currently working on a webservice with the same purpose that should work more seamlessly.
